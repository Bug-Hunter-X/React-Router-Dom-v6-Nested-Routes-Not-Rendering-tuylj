This repository demonstrates a common issue and its solution when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The problem occurs when nested routes fail to render properly, potentially due to path configuration errors or missing elements in the parent route.  The solution offers a corrected implementation to ensure proper rendering of nested routes.
